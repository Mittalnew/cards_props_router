    "topstory": "It became really clear to me that we needed to do something now. That it’s fundamentally going to impact the quality of life — that I’m going to have when I’m older, but also that of my kids. It’s the thing that drives us as a company.I grew up in Calgary, Alberta originally. My parents were entrepreneurs, so they did all kinds of things, but the most consistent thing they did throughout my childhood was property management.

We’re doing that by building a commerce platform that makes buying major home electrical appliances like EV chargers, and eventually heat pumps, induction stoves, solar panels, home batteries et cetera much easier. Right now, these upgrades are like home remodels that people have to manage. We want to turn them into something as simple as an online purchase. You can click and buy and take care of installation all at once.We started the company in late 2021, and we’re up to six people now."
